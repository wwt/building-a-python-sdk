# :gear: Creating a Python SDK

The goal of this repository is to provide an overview of how to create a Python SDK targeted at a couple of the Cisco product APIs.  Yes...there are already SDKs created for these products, but the goal isn't develop a production quality SDK when one already exists, but to provide a guided walk-through to gain hands-on experience using many of the sktill learned.

## Clone the Repo

The first step to working through this hands-on tour of developing a Python SDK is **cloning** the repository to your local machine.

## Development Environment

The development environment is where all of your work is done.  This includes writing code and executing code during the development lifecycle.

It is a common practice to use Docker containers as a portable solution to development environments.  This helps avoid the "...it works on my machine..." problem.
