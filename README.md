# :gear: Creating a Python SDK

The goal of this repository is to provide an overview of how to create a Python SDK targeted at a couple of the Cisco product APIs.  Yes...there are already SDKs created for these products, but the goal isn't develop a production quality SDK when one already exists, but to provide a guided walk-through to gain hands-on experience using many of the sktill learned.
