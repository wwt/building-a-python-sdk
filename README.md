# :gear: Creating a Python SDK

[![Build Documentation w/ MkDocs](https://github.com/wwt/building-a-python-sdk/actions/workflows/mkdocs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wwt/building-a-python-sdk/actions/workflows/mkdocs.yml)

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to provide an overview of how to create a Python SDK targeted at a couple of the Cisco product APIs.  Yes...there are already SDKs created for these products, but the goal isn't develop a production quality SDK when one already exists, but to provide a guided walk-through to gain hands-on experience using many of the sktill learned.

## Documentation

The guide for this repository is located [here](https://wwt.github.io/building-a-python-sdk).
