# Learn to Build a Basic Python SDK

Practice is critical in acquiring any new skill and automation is no different.  This repository will walk you through the creation of a simple, non-production Python SDK.  The goal is not to create a production quality Python SDK since these already exist for many of the Cisco products, but rather to provide some guided practice using many of the requisite skills of an automation engineer today. 

Some of the skills you will practice in this walk-through are:

- Docker and Development Environments
- Version Control
- Basic Linux Commands 
- Python Fundamentals
- Common Data Formats (specifically JSON)
- Development Design Patterns and Methodology

Through the remainder of this guide you will be walked, step-by-step, through the process of building your own SDK.  

## Prerequisite Skills

This walk-through assumes knowledge of:

- `git`
- Docker
- Python Fundamentals
- REST APIs
